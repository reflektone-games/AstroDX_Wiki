# App Installation

It's as easy as 1-2-3.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Downloading the APK
Head to the official [AstroDX GitHub Releases](https://github.com/2394425147/maipaddx/releases) page in order to download the APK.
</Step>
<Step>
### Installing

For many Android devices, it will tell you that for security reasons, [your browser] is not allowed to install unknown apps.

However, just go into the settings and enable the permission for your browser. It's that simple.

</Step>

<Step>
### Initializing AstroDX

After installing the game, you should open it up at least once in order to initialize the game.

This will make it easier for you to install your songs later.

</Step>
</Steps>

**There won’t be any songs by default!** That’s ok, we’ll get songs later **in the next section**.

# Installing Levels

<Callout>
  If you're using an older version of **AstroDX e.g. 2.0 pre-beta** or an
  earlier version, please [go here for instructions.]() Do note that support is
  not guaranteed on legacy versions of the game.
</Callout>

### Where are the charts?

Let's get this out of the way.

  >
    The question you've all been waiting for. Maybe. Probably.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### **Import via ADX archive** **(Recommended, Beta 2 Patch 4 and later)**

This is the primary way to install levels, and it’s incredibly easy to get started.

<Steps>

<Step>
  ### Rename your zip file Any given `.zip` file of a level or multiple levels
  can be **renamed** into a `.adx` file.
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Open with... > AstroDX On supported devices, tap on the file in any file
  manager, and select `Open with… > AstroDX`
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Profit AstroDX will automatically install levels for you [depending on
  what the archive contains](https://www.notion.so/ADX-Archive-Det).
</Step>

</Steps>

<Callout title="On some devices, (for example Xiaomi or some Samsung devices), your file manager may not offfer the option to open with AstroDX." type="warn">

Try one of these options:
[**ZArchiver**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver&hl=en) /
[**Android SAF**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marc.files&pcampaignid=web_share)

</Callout>

Rename any `.adx` file back into `.zip` to extract it as usual.

### Manual import

Installing levels like older versions is still supported.

To install collections, you’ll need to create and author a manifest file. Learn more about it here:

## Updating from older versions

AstroDX automatically transfers your levels, collections and scores to the new version.

If it fails, a backup file is available in the root folder of AstroDX, and you can open up a thread in the [#help](https://discord.com/channels/892807792996536453/1017394299933044847) forums.

# FAQ (Fully Anticipated Questions)

<Accordions>
	<Accordion title="I've put the .rar/.zip file into `/levels`, but it's still not working!">

That's the old way of doing things. It'll still technically work for solo levels, but collections are now done differently. Arguably, better.

    If you’re using 2.0 Beta 2 Patch 4 or later, you’re probably better off using [the .adx archive method](https://www.notion.so/Installation-Guide-for-Android-3f2ec5041ad5413ab45500472bb4ceba?pvs=21).
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is there a way to turn off Notifications? I keep on sliding it down.">

    Fortunately for you, there is a Guided Access-like feature in Android.

    It’s called Pin app, and how you turn it on depends on what device you are using.

    Except if you’re using a Xiaomi. If you are, you’re SOL. Sorry.
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="I've put the mv.mp4 (or bg.mp4) file into the folder, but it isn't playing!">

    AstroDX only detects `pv.mp4` for video files. `mv.mp4` is what is needed to run the video in [Majdata](https://rentry.org/maiguide).
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there SD card support?">

    Unfortunately, not at this time. It is surprisingly complicated to implement support for SD cards.

    Alternatively, you can *try* to find a way to make symlinks inside of Android (since it is basically Linux). I haven’t found a way to make it work yet. Good luck!
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why isn't the game on the Google Play Store?">

    We do not yet qualify for deployment on the Play Store, and we want to be a fully fleshed game before we do so.

    Also, we might be on other app marketplaces instead of the Play Store due to exorbitant rates. It's not free.
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do you need to go through the hassle of having to go to the weird directory?">

    Due to limitations within Android, apps are only allowed to access a specific subset of files.

    Google's reason for this was security, but if we're being real if the apps wanted access outside of the Scoped Storage there are a plethora of workarounds available using archaic permissions. Good job, Google.
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="[2.0 Beta] Why are we changing the storage layout?">

    As you might have known, in previous versions of AstroDX, levels can be either put in the top-level (Directly inside the `levels` folder), or you can put one or more levels inside another named folder to make a **collection**. This made it easy to customize collections straight in the file system, though it also introduces some interesting problems.

    **You can’t use the same level in multiple collections.** Since collections exist as folders, it’s difficult to find a way to put the same level inside many folders at the same time. Even if it’s possible, managing shortcuts and links will certainly be difficult when it comes to deleting a level or moving a level elsewhere.

    **Multiple levels can have the same name.** Although we use folders to group levels, the levels are expanded into a singular list in the game. This makes it possible to have two or more folders of the same name, creating a key collision in the game’s dictionary of levels. And when you’re adding levels to a sea of folders, it’s difficult to identify whether a folder of the same name already exists.

    By using an alternative way to represent the collections, though we made it slightly more complex to edit collection data (which we’re working on adding an in-game collections manager to fix), we’re able to fix the issues mentioned above.
