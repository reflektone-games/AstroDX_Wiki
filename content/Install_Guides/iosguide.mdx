# App installation
Here's how you can install the app.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Download TestFlight
You'll need to download the [TestFlight app](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/testflight/id899247664).
</Step>

<Step>
### TestFlight Invitation
You'll be able to find the links in our [Discord server](https://sht.moe/astrodx), in the [#testflight](https://discord.com/channels/892807792996536453/1210127565986205726) channel.

	However, you'll be missing out on live updates for when slots free up. Your choice. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
</Step>
<Step>
### First launch
Once the app is finished downloading, launch it once to initialise the game. This makes it easier for you to install songs later.
</Step>
</Steps>

**There wonâ€™t be any songs by default!** Thatâ€™s ok, weâ€™ll get songs later **in the next section**.

# Installing Levels
### Where are the charts?
Let's get this out of the way.
<Cards>
<Card
title="Chart download where?"
href="https://discord.com/channels/892807792996536453/1081048213185900584"
>
The question you've all been waiting for. Maybe. Probably.
</Card>
</Cards>

Here's how you can put those levels into your game.
<Steps>
<Step>
### Navigating to the directory
Using the Files app, navigate to the `AstroDX/levels/` folder.
<Callout
title="Did you download your charts on your computer instead?"
>
For Mac OS users, I assume you can just AirDrop the files to your device.

I don't have a Mac myself, so I can't show you how, but it should be possible.

	For Windows and Linux users, I recommend heading to [this section](#localsend-an-open-source-alternative-to-airdrop) where I go into detail how to transfer files efficiently to i[Pad]OS.
	</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
### Installing the charts
- The new AstroDX update has made installing new charts simultaneously simpler but also more complex. You'll see what I mean.

 **For the purpose of this guide, a `collection` is basically a folder of charts. You'll be familiar with this structure.** `24. PRiSM/Chronomia`
<Accordions>
<Accordion
title="Here's how you install new charts and collections:">
	<Steps>
	<Step>
	Download the `.zip` archive for the chart/collection that you want.
	</Step>
	<Step>
	Rename that `.zip` file and change the extension to `.adx`.

		<p className="text-sm opacity-50"> For example, `24. PRiSM.zip` now becomes `24. PRiSM.adx`. Same goes for single charts. </p>
	</Step>
	<Step>
	Move that .adx file into the `AstroDX` folder, located in your Files.

	**No, not `levels`.**
</Step>
</Steps>
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
**That's it.** The next time you open the game, AstroDX will automagically sort your levels out for you, and you can enjoy the charts.
</Step>
</Steps>

If you want to change the collection details, like say add a new single chart into a collection, it becomes a bit more complicated.
<Callout
title="Do you want to modify your collections further?"
>
**Skip over this next section** (or even exit the guide, because you're done) if you're uninterested in changing anything.
</Callout>
Inside of your `AstroDX` folder, you will find a `collections` folder and a `levels` folder.
	- The `collections` folder ONLY stores information about the individual collections, located in subfolders.
	- The `levels` folder ONLY stores files that are related to your charts.

If you want to modify a collection, say to add a chart into one, you'll have to go into that subfolder and change information about the `manifest.json` file.

Feel free to read the information about the file located [here](https://astrodx.notion.site/Collection-Manifest-Details-8f966de6971748e0ac01c0a0a6054594), but **TL;DR**:

In the `manifest.json` file, you will have this format. Reading this should give you an idea of how it works.

```json
{
    "name": "Collection name",
    "id": null, // you can ignore this
    "serverUrl": null, // you can ignore this
    "levelIds": ["Each item here", "is a folder inside", "the levels folder"]
}
```
Exactly as formatted, that's how a `manifest.json` file works.

#### LocalSend â€“ an open source alternative to AirDrop
This section is basically quintessential if you want to transfer files from your PC to your iPhone / iPad (unless it's a Mac, in which case just use AirDrop)

Download LocalSend on both your PC and your device.
<Cards>
<Card
title="App Store"
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229"
>
</Card>
<Card
title="Official Website for PC Download"
href="https://localsend.org/"
>
</Card>
</Cards>
Make sure that both devices are on the same WiFi network.

Keep the LocalSend app open on your mobile device. On your PC:
<Steps>
<Step> Open the Send menu. </Step>
<Step> Choose "File", and select the `.adx` file that includes your charts. </Step>
<Step> Your iPhone or iPad should be in this menu as well, with a codename. Click on the name. </Step>
<Step> Check your device. It should now have a prompt asking you if you want to Accept the files. Of course, Accept. </Step>
<Step> The files should now be in your Files app, under `LocalSend`. </Step>
<Step> Just move the transferred `.adx` file to `AstroDX`, and you're done! </Step>
</Steps>
Just pop into the game and enjoy AstroDX.

# FAQ (Fully Anticipated Questions)

<Accordions>
	<Accordion title="I've put the .rar/.zip file into `/levels`, but it's still not working!">

    You'll need to extract it first.

    Youâ€™re probably better off using [the .adx archive method](#navigating-to-the-directory) though.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is there a way to turn off Notifications? I keep on sliding it down.">

    Use [**Guided Access**](https://www.google.com/search?q=ios+guided+access).

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion
    title="Information regarding file compatibility"
    >
	I couldn't phrase the question right, so I'm just gonna dump this info here.

	The officially supported types of codecs for AstroDX on iOS:
		- **Video:** H.264
		- **Audio:** OGG Vorbis (with .ogg extension) **OR**  mp3 (with .mp3 extension)
	</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I've put the mv.mp4 (or bg.mp4) file into the folder, but it isn't playing!">

    AstroDX only detectsÂ `pv.mp4`Â for video files.Â `mv.mp4`Â is what is needed to run the video inÂ [Majdata](https://rentry.org/maiguide).
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why isn't the game on the App Store?">

    The reasons are twofold. We do not yet qualify for deployment on the App Store, and we want to be a fully fleshed game before we do so.

    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can you send out a .ipa file so that we can sideload the game?">

   Wish we could, but here's the reason why we can't:

    > For the time being, ipa sideloading isn't recommended. In short, publishing ipa files allow people to distribute AstroDX as their own on the app store, and potentially profit from it by inserting ads or adding paid restrictions. We wanted to make sure the game is pushed to the app store rightfully, so that's why we're not planning on publishing any ipa files.

   **TL;DR:** Bad people is why we can't have nice things.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why is the TestFlight so often full? When will I get my chance to play?">
    The short answer is: too many players want to play this game.

    The reason why there's a specific amount of slots is because that's all we can afford to open right now. It costs us to open these groups for you guys, and we're paying out of pocket.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="If the slots run out that quickly, why don't you just open more groups? Why not a Group E and a Group F and so on?">
    Read above.
    </Accordion>

<Accordion title="[2.0 Beta] Why are we changing the storage layout?">

    As you might have known, in previous versions of AstroDX, levels can be either put in the top-level (Directly inside the `levels` folder), or you can put one or more levels inside another named folder to make a **collection**. This made it easy to customize collections straight in the file system, though it also introduces some interesting problems.

    **You canâ€™t use the same level in multiple collections.** Since collections exist as folders, itâ€™s difficult to find a way to put the same level inside many folders at the same time. Even if itâ€™s possible, managing shortcuts and links will certainly be difficult when it comes to deleting a level or moving a level elsewhere.

    **Multiple levels can have the same name.** Although we use folders to group levels, the levels are expanded into a singular list in the game. This makes it possible to have two or more folders of the same name, creating a key collision in the gameâ€™s dictionary of levels. And when youâ€™re adding levels to a sea of folders, itâ€™s difficult to identify whether a folder of the same name already exists.

    By using an alternative way to represent the collections, though we made it slightly more complex to edit collection data (which weâ€™re working on adding an in-game collections manager to fix), weâ€™re able to fix the issues mentioned above.
